# Interpreting_NNs_for_topological_phases_of_matter
This is a repository accompanying: 
1) B.Sc. thesis "Improving generalization of neural networks by interpretation for topological phases of matter" by K. Cybiński, written under supervision of prof. Michał Tomza, and dr Anna Dawid
2) research paper "Improving generalization of neural networks by interpretation for topological phases of matter" by K. Cybiński, M. Płodzień, M. Tomza, A. Dauphin, M. Lewenstein, A. Dawid - in preparation

The code in this repository was used for obtaining all the results presented in abovementioned works.   
   
The demonstration of ML operations process is presented in file [CNN_dev.ipynb](./CNN_dev.ipynb), with more detailed description to follow shortly.
